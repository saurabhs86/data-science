        "For example, let's say that an instance of `monster_name` contained three values: `Black Knight`, `Werewolf`, `Dracula`. `Black Knight` would end up in a new column called `monster_name_part_1`. `Werewolf` would end up in a new column called `monster_name_part_2`. `Dracula` would end up in a new column called `monster_name_part_3`. Their respective monster attributes would work similar such as `monster_gender_part_1` for the `Black Knight`'s gender, `monster_gender_part_2` for the `Werewolf`'s gender, `monster_gender_part_3` for `Dracula`'s gender, etc.\n",
